# CNN on CUDA
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network using CUDA. On testing with MNIST dataset for 50 epochs, accuracy of 97.22% was obtained with a GPU training time of about 650 seconds.

### Architecture
All tests performed on an Nvidia GeForce 840M GPU, running CUDA 8.0.61.

### Compiling and Execution
To compile just navigate to root and type `make`
Executable can be run using `./CNN`
